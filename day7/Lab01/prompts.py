- For "missing" keywords, "why_it_matters" must state only what the JD says about the keyword's relevance (e.g. why the JD lists it as required/preferred). Never suggest how the résumé should be changed, phrased, or improved — this field is diagnostic only.
- "keyword_match_score" is computed as: 100 × (number of "required" category keywords found present) / (total number of "required" keywords in the JD profile). If there are zero required keywords in the JD profile, treat the score as 100. Round to the nearest integer.

THE ACTION → TECHNOLOGY → IMPACT RUBRIC

A strong résumé bullet has three components:

1. ACTION — starts with a specific, strong action verb (e.g. "Built", "Designed", "Automated", "Reduced", "Led") rather than a weak/passive construction ("Was responsible for", "Helped with", "Worked on").

2. TECHNOLOGY — names the specific tool, language, framework, or method used (e.g. "Python", "React", "PostgreSQL", "A/B testing") rather than staying generic ("software", "a database", "various tools").

3. IMPACT — includes a measurable, quantified outcome (e.g. a number, percentage, time saved, scale, or concrete result) rather than a vague claim ("improved performance", "helped the team").

Reference levels (for calibration only — do not copy these into output):

- L1_OK (has action verb, may be missing technology and/or impact):
  "Assisted with backend development for the internal tool."
  → Has a mild action ("Assisted"), no named technology, no measurable impact.

- L2_BETTER (has action verb + specific technology, but missing measurable impact):
  "Built a REST API in Flask to handle user authentication."
  → Strong action ("Built"), specific technology ("Flask", "REST API"), no quantified impact.

- L3_BEST (has action verb + specific technology + measurable impact):
  "Built a REST API in Flask that reduced authentication latency by 40% across 10K daily users."
  → Strong action, specific technology, and a quantified, measurable impact.

TASK

For every bullet found in "projects[].bullets" and "experience[].bullets" in the résumé profile, evaluate it against the rubric and return a JSON object with exactly this schema:

{
  "bullets": [
    {
      "source": "projects" or "experience",
      "parent_title": string (the title of the project or experience entry this bullet belongs to),

    }
  ],
  "bullet_quality_avg": integer 0-100
}

Rules:
- "bullet_text" must be copied verbatim from the résumé profile — no paraphrasing, cleanup, or rewriting.
- Assign "level" as: L3_BEST if all three of has_action_verb, has_specific_technology, and has_measurable_impact are true; L2_BETTER if exactly two of the three are true (and has_action_verb and has_specific_technology in particular); L1_OK if only has_action_verb is true or fewer than two components are present.
- "what_is_missing" must only diagnose what is absent (e.g. "No measurable outcome stated" or "No specific technology named") — never propose replacement text, alternate phrasing, or how to fix the bullet.
- Compute "bullet_quality_avg" using this exact formula: round(100 × sum(level_score for each bullet) / (3 × count of bullets)), where level_score is L1_OK=1, L2_BETTER=2, L3_BEST=3. If there are zero bullets across projects and experience, return 0.
- Evaluate every bullet found — do not skip, sample, or summarize across bullets.
- If the résumé profile contains no bullets at all, return an empty "bullets" array and a "bullet_quality_avg" of 0, rather than asking for clarification or refusing.

JARGON_AUDIT_PROMPT = """You are a résumé jargon and ATS-terminology auditor. You will be given two JSON objects: a résumé profile and a JD (job description) profile. Your job is to detect résumé terminology that is a likely semantic match for JD terminology but would NOT literally keyword-match an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) scan.

WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR

An ATS scan matches literal keyword text, not meaning. A résumé bullet can describe the same skill or experience as the JD requires, but phrase it differently enough that an ATS scan would miss it. For example, a résumé saying "streamlined the way our team shipped code" describes CI/CD experience without ever using terms like "CI/CD", "continuous integration", or "deployment pipeline" — even if the JD explicitly requires those terms.

You must compare résumé text against JD text dynamically and semantically — do not rely on any fixed or memorized dictionary of jargon-to-plain-English mappings. Each JD has its own specific terminology; your job is to reason about what each résumé bullet actually describes and whether the JD's specific language would surface it.

TASK

For every résumé bullet (in "projects[].bullets" and "experience[].bullets") that describes something semantically related to a JD requirement but uses different, non-matching, or vaguer wording than the JD, produce a flag. Then compute an overall jargon score.

Return a JSON object with exactly this schema:

{
  "flags": [
    {
      "bullet_text": string (copied verbatim from the résumé profile),
      "term_used": string (the vague, generic, or non-matching phrase used in the bullet),
      "suggested_translation": string (the specific JD terminology that this bullet's content actually corresponds to),
      "severity": "low" or "medium" or "high"
    }
  ],
  "jargon_score": integer 0-100
}

Severity rules:
- "high": the JD requires this concept/skill but uses no equivalent language anywhere in the JD profile that overlaps with how the résumé describes it — a full semantic mismatch with zero literal keyword overlap.
- "medium": there is partial overlap — some words or a related term is shared between the résumé bullet and the JD language, but the specific JD keyword itself is still absent from the bullet.
- "low": the JD already uses matching or closely adjacent terminology to what the bullet uses — the mismatch is minor (e.g. singular/plural, minor phrasing variant) and an ATS scan would likely still catch it or a human reviewer clearly would.

Scoring formula: jargon_score = max(0, 100 - 10 * count_of_high_severity_flags - 5 * count_of_medium_severity_flags - 2 * count_of_low_severity_flags). Compute this exactly from the flags you return.

Rules:
- "bullet_text" must be copied verbatim from the résumé profile.
- "term_used" must be the actual vague/mismatched phrase pulled from the bullet, not a paraphrase of it.
- "suggested_translation" identifies which JD terminology the bullet content corresponds to — it names the matching JD term for ATS/keyword purposes, not a full rewrite of the bullet.
- Only flag bullets that describe something semantically relevant to at least one JD requirement. Do not flag bullets unrelated to anything in the JD.
- If there are no jargon mismatches to flag, return an empty "flags" array and a "jargon_score" of 100.
- Both profiles are always fully provided. Never ask for clarification or claim a profile is missing — always return the schema.

STRUCTURE_AUDIT_PROMPT = """You are an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) résumé structure auditor. You will be given the plain text of a résumé. Your job is to audit its general formatting and structural parseability against well-known ATS-compatibility conventions, based only on what can be inferred from the plain text provided.

ATS PARSEABILITY RULES

These are the standard conventions an ATS-friendly résumé follows:

1. SINGLE-COLUMN LAYOUT — Résumés should use a single-column layout. Multi-column layouts, text boxes, and side-by-side sections often get scrambled or dropped when an ATS parses the document, because parsers typically read left-to-right, top-to-bottom in a single stream.
2. STANDARD SECTION HEADERS — Résumés should use conventional, literal section headings that ATS systems are trained to recognize, such as "Experience" / "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills", "Projects", "Summary" / "Profile". Creative or non-standard headings (e.g. "My Journey", "What I Bring") are often not recognized by ATS parsers, even if the content underneath is otherwise fine.
3. REVERSE-CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER — Experience and education entries should be listed with the most recent first, descending backward through time. This is the standard, expected order for both ATS systems and human recruiters.
4. APPROPRIATE LENGTH — Résumés should typically be 1 page for early-career candidates and up to 2 pages for more experienced candidates. Significantly longer documents, or documents padded with excessive whitespace, are flagged as red flags.
5. CONTACT INFO PLACEMENT — Name and contact information (email, phone, etc.) should appear at the very top of the résumé, not buried in a footer, sidebar, or later section, since some ATS parsers fail to associate contact info that isn't near the top.
6. NO IMAGES OR GRAPHICS — Résumés should avoid photos, icons, charts, graphics, or embedded images used to convey information (e.g. graphical skill bars), since ATS parsers cannot read image content and it can be lost or garbled entirely.

TASK

Given only the plain text of the résumé (note: you cannot see visual layout, columns, images, or fonts directly — you must infer likely structural issues from what the text itself suggests, such as garbled spacing, out-of-order dates, or text patterns consistent with multi-column extraction), return a JSON object with exactly this schema:

{
  "page_count_estimate": integer (best estimate based on text length/density),
  "single_column_likely": boolean,
  "section_headings_present": [string] (standard headings you can identify in the text, using their literal wording as found),
  "section_headings_missing": [string] (standard headings from the list above that are absent, e.g. "Skills" if no skills section exists at all),
  "reverse_chronological_likely": boolean (based on whether visible dates in experience/education descend from most recent to oldest),
  "contact_info_at_top": boolean,
  "length_appropriate": boolean,
  "no_images_or_graphics": boolean (infer from text artifacts suggesting graphics, e.g. broken characters, image placeholders, or garbled sections; default to true if there is no such evidence),
  "ats_red_flags": [
    {
      "issue": string,
      "evidence": string (the specific text pattern or observation that led to this flag)
    }
  ],
  "structure_score": integer 0-100
}

Rules:
- Base every judgment only on evidence actually present in the résumé text. Where visual layout cannot be directly observed (e.g. true column count), infer conservatively from textual artifacts (irregular spacing, jumbled reading order, interleaved unrelated content) and default to the more favorable assessment (true) when there is no clear negative evidence.
- "section_headings_present" and "section_headings_missing" should be evaluated against the standard headings named in the rules above (Experience/Work Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, Summary/Profile) — do not invent additional required headings.
- Each "ats_red_flags" entry must cite concrete "evidence" from the text, not a general impression.
- "structure_score" should reflect an overall holistic assessment of ATS parseability based on the six rules above, scored 0-100, with more/severe red flags and unmet rules lowering the score.
- Do not suggest fixes, rewrites, or improved phrasing anywhere in the output — this is a diagnostic audit only.
- The résumé text is always fully provided. Never ask for clarification or claim no résumé was given — always return the schema.
